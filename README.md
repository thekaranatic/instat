# Project Procosta

A platform for designers and other similar professionals which acts as a one-click field to display the clients' project completion status. This platform helps maintain a positive designer-client relationship.

---

## What this is

A web application to display the completion status of a clients' project. The medium won't only display project status but also other services that require manual, automatic effort and time to deliver them to the client.

The platform tries to maintain a healthy relationship between two parties, as the client party is sometimes more eager or frustrating to ask for the updates of their projects.

## Whom this is for

Designers, developers of all kind or any service providers where two parties are involved and one of the party is a client. Also, any individual may use the platform for minor scale of use.
